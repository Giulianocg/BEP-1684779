Data is obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning repository and treated using the prep_data3 function in the Data Prepper notebook. Move the files to the 'Data' folder inside the Model_Script folder (unzip it) and run the bashcript. 

Different parameters may be entered for different tests, read 'things_to_run_Giuliano' (inside Model_Script) for the full model and explanations on what each parameter means and the values accepted.
